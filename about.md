# About this site

I set out to make this site in response to the multitude of bloated cooking sites with the following goals:

- No ads
- No tracking
- No js
- No bullshit
- All recipes in metric

With all of these in mind, the site should be quick and responsive. The recipes should be easy to replicate and free of bs.
Contributions are welcome, I'll add a contribution guide later on.
